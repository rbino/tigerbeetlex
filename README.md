# TigerBeetlex

Elixir client for [TigerBeetle](https://github.com/tigerbeetledb/tigerbeetle).

## Usage

More documentation is coming, for now check out the integration test in the `test` directory.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `tigerbeetlex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tigerbeetlex, github: "rbino/tigerbeetlex"}
  ]
end
```

and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/tigerbeetlex>.

### Setup

Clone the repo and fetch dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rbino/tigerbeetlex.git
$ cd tigerbeetlex
$ mix deps.get
```

In a new terminal session, download TigerBeetle using the right command for your OS:

```bash
# Linux
curl -Lo tigerbeetle.zip https://linux.tigerbeetle.com && unzip tigerbeetle.zip

# macOS
curl -Lo tigerbeetle.zip https://mac.tigerbeetle.com && unzip tigerbeetle.zip

# Windows
powershell -command "curl.exe -Lo tigerbeetle.zip https://windows.tigerbeetle.com; Expand-Archive tigerbeetle.zip"
```

Then create the data file and start your development cluster

```bash
./tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica=0 --replica-count=1 --development 0_0.tigerbeetle
./tigerbeetle start --addresses=3000 --development 0_0.tigerbeetle
```

See the [TigerBeetle documentation](https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/) for more info.

Finally, in the first terminal, ensure the tests pass:

```bash
$ mix test
```
