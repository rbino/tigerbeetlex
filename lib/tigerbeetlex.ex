  Creates a processless TigerBeetlex client.

  The returned client can be safely shared between multiple processes. Each process will receive
  the responses to the requests it submits.

  ## Arguments

  - `cluster_id` (128-bit binary ID): - The TigerBeetle cluster id.
  - `addresses` (list of `String.t()`) - The list of node addresses. These can either be a single
  digit (e.g. `"3000"`), which is interpreted as a port on `127.0.0.1`, an IP address + port (e.g.
  `"127.0.0.1:3000"`), or just an IP address (e.g. `"127.0.0.1"`), which defaults to port `3001`.

  ## Examples

      {:ok, client} = TigerBeetlex.connect(<<0::128>>, ["3000"])

  Creates a batch of accounts.

  `client` is a `%TigerBeetlex{}` client.

  `account_batch` is a `%TigerBeetlex.AccountBatch{}`, see `TigerBeetlex.AccountBatch` for
  the functions to create and manipulate it.

  The function returns a ref which can be used to match the received response message.

  The response message has this format:

      {:tigerbeetlex_response, request_ref, response}

  Where `request_ref` is the same `ref` returned when this function was called and `response` is
  a response that can be decoded using `TigerBeetlex.Response.decode/1`.

  The value returned from `TigerBeetlex.Response.decode(response)` will either be
  `{:error, reason}` or `{:ok, results}`.

  `results` is a list of `%TigerBeetlex.CreateAccountsResult{}` structs
  which contain the index of the account batch and the reason of the failure. An account has a
  corresponding `%TigerBeetlex.CreateAccountsResult{}` only if it fails to be created, otherwise
  the account has been created succesfully (so a successful request returns an empty list).

  ## Examples

      # Successful request
      batch =
        TigerBeetlex.AccountBatch.new!(10)
